## project 1: User Sign-up Form with Validation

This project has a simple and reusable form for signing-up (login) of a user.<br/>
It showcases:

- single file components (the SFC design pattern)
- `v-model` with components
- conditional rendering with `v-if`
- computed properties
- validation

### Run

As prerequisite, install the dependencies using `yarn`.

Use `yarn vite` to run it in _development_ mode: it reloads the page using a mechanism called 'hot module replacement'.

### Notes

The project was created using `yarn create @vitejs/app`.
